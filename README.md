# GitHub Complex Repository Analyzer

The GitHub Repository Analyzer is a web application that analyzes the technical complexity of GitHub repositories and provides insights on their complexity. It uses a pre-trained language model to evaluate repository names and select the most complex one. Additionally, it generates a justification for the selection using the language model.

## Features

- Fetches repositories from a GitHub user's profile
- Scores the repositories based on their technical complexity
- Identifies the most complex repository
- Generates a justification for the selection using a language model

- ## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask (web framework)
- Requests (HTTP library)
- PyTorch (deep learning library)
- Hugging Face Transformers (NLP library)

- ## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/ShakthiVar/MercorMLProject.git
   cd MercorMLProject

## Implementation Steps
